#README

Instructions:

Create an app that has three buttons, one for incrementing a counter, one for decrementing the
 counter, and one for resetting the counter to 0. The counter must be displayed as a TextView
 and must retain its state when the phone is rotated between portrait and landscape modes. There
 should be no values, such as strings, dimensions, etc. hardcoded in the .java files. They should
 be maintained and accessed from the appropriate resource files.

TODO:

Open Android Studio and create an Android project named Button-counter-<yourLastName>.
Create a .gitignore file and put the neccessary file names that do not belong in GitHub.
Create a README.md and put '#README' in it.
VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on GitHub. Use 'Initial Commit' as commit message.
Verify files were uploaded to your GitHub account.
Complete the project.

When you are complete with your project, commit and push files to GitHub. VCS -> Commit Changes

Note: Any issues you have with either the GitHub steps or Java/Android questions should be asked
publically in Piazza. If you have a question, chances are someone else does also. If you see
someone has posted a question on Piazza and you know the answer, please chime in and answer.
This might seem rough at the beginning, but I promise it will get easier.
